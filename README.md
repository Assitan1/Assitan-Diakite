# Hello-world
Hi my name is Assitan Diakite. This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow. I would like to introduce myself. I am from Mali, West Africa & have been in the US for the past 10 years.
I am a very curious personal that loves to learn new concepts mainly anything that is related to problem solving real world issues. My goal for the next few years is to become a Data Scientist or Analyst and specialize in something "education" related as I have been a math teacher for a while now.
